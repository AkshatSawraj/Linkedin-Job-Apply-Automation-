## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1. Install selenium. I used `pip` to install the selenium package.

`pip install selenium`

2. Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Make sure the driver is in your path, you will need to add your `driver_path` to the `config.json` file.

I used the Chrome driver, you can download it [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

### Usage

Fill in the config.json file and then Run the python main.py script
